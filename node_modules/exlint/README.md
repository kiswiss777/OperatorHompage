# Exlint

A self-contained eslint profile that requires no boilerplate setup such as installing several profiles and plugins. Uses `babel-eslint` out of the box for bleeding-edge ES6/ES7.

## How to Use

Use `exlint` exactly as you would use `eslint`.

```bash
# globally
npm install exlint -g
# or locally
npm install exlint --save-dev

exlint path/to/dir
```

## Rules

`exlint` is based on [standard](http://standardjs.com) with a few tweaks based on my personal coding preference. The following rules are enforced on top of the standard config:

- Use `const` if variable is immutable
- Use a comma dangle with multiline objects
- Use open spacing in objects `{ foo: 'bar' }`
- Wrap arrow function parameters in parentheses `(a) => {}`, `(a, b) => {}`
- Use the correct order for requiring/importing modules: native node modules, installed modules, custom modules in the same directory, then custom modules in upper directories.
